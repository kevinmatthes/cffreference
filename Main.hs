Description: The main source file of this project.

A simple application in order to extract citation information from a given CFF
file.

The application itself accepts one or two arguments which will be interpreted as
the paths to existing, readable and valid CFF files.  The first argument will
always be treated as the input file.  It will be evaluated in order to determine
the lines to cite in the target @CITATION.cff@.  The lines to cite will be
written to @stdout@, by default, such that the content can be piped around in a
terminal session.

If the optional second argument is given, it will be treated as the path to an
existing, readable and writable file.  The input will be processed as in the
default case.  But in contrast, the lines to cite will be appended at the end of
the given output file.

If no or more than two arguments are given, the application will show a brief
information on how to pass the arguments and quit.

This application always terminates with code @0x0@.
