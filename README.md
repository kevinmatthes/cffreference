## Summary

A simple CLI to extract citation information from a CITATION.cff.

## License

This project's license is **GPL 2** (as of June 1991).  The whole license text
can be found in `LICENSE` in the main directory of this repository.  The brief
version is as follows:

> Copyright (C) 2022 Kevin Matthes
>
> This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
> it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
> the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
> (at your option) any later version.
>
> This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
> but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

When compiling a printable version of this documentation using Pandoc, the full
license will be attached automatically to the resulting document.  This can be
invoked by calling `repository-manual.m`.

## Software Requirements

| Requirement       | Type          | Role                                  |
|:------------------|:-------------:|:--------------------------------------|
| `docs-snippets`   | repository    | documentation constants               |
| GHC               | application   | Haskell compiler                      |
| GNU Octave        | application   | execution of the provided scripts     |
| Haddock           | application   | creation of source code documentation |
| Pandoc            | application   | compilation of repository manual      |
| `texlive-full`    | package       | compilation of repository manual      |

The compilation of such an **optional** repository manual can be invoked by just
calling one of the following lines in a terminal.

```
octave repository-manual.m
octave-cli repository-manual.m
```

Both will redirect to the same application, GNU Octave, which will then create
the manual for this repository and attach the entire license to it.  The
resulting file, `repository.pdf`, will be saved in the main directory of this
repository.
